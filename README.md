This library enables the creation of arithmetic circuits from circom programs.

We aim to support canonical circomlib.

Other important components such as circomlib-ml reside under apps.

## Requirements

- Rust: To install, follow the instructions found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Getting Started

- Write your circom program in the `assets` directory under the `circuit.circom` name.

- Build the program

```bash
cargo build --release
```

- Run the compilation

```
cargo run
```

## Configuration

The CLI provides options to specify both input and output file paths, allowing flexibility in how you manage your circom program files and the resulting arithmetic circuits.

### Command Line Arguments

- `--input`: Specifies the path to the input circom program file. By default, the program looks for `circuit.circom` in the `assets` directory.
- `--output`: Specifies the path to the output directory where the generated arithmetic circuit files will be stored. By default, it's saved in the `./output` directory.

#### Example

To run the program with specific input and output file paths, use the following command format:

```bash
cargo run -- --inputs ./program/circuit.circom --output ./dist/output/
```
